# JohnLemons

Author: Davis Bosworth (whole project)

Particle effect: Small flames added to the scene, used as a target for linear interpolation.
Linear interpolation: Extra ghost behind John Lemons at start of game; uses lerp to travel to the otherside of the room with a flame as the target.
Dot product: Used by all ghosts and gargoyles to end the game when John steps into their eye line.
